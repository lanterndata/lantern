# - every test that needs to be run must appear in a 'test:' line
# - every test that needs to be run and is expected to fail must appear in an 'ignore:' line *before* the corresponding test line
# - every test that needs to be run iff pgvector is installed appears in a 'pgvector:' line
# - 'ignore' lines must have exactly one test
# - 'test' lines may have multiple space-separated tests. All tests in a single 'test' line will be run in parallel
