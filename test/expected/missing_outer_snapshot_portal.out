-- This test is to check that Lantern properly handles missing outer snapshots or portals when it is loaded
-- So far, this test checks that Lantern handles cases of initializing parallel workers properly.
-- Specifically, we test that Lantern performs the version match check by only performing its initialization SQL queries when a proper outer snapshot or portal exists. 
-- This is to prevent the following error: "ERROR:  cannot execute SQL without an outer snapshot or portal"
-- Note: Dropping and loading the extension again is necessary to test the desired missing outer snapshot/portal behavior
