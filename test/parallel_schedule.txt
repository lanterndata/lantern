# schedule.txt rules:
# - every test that needs to be run must appear in a 'test:' line
# - every test that needs to be run iff pgvector is installed appears in a 'test_pgvector:' line
# - 'test' lines may have multiple space-separated tests. All tests in a single 'test' line will be run in parallel

test_begin: begin
test: insert insert2
test_end: end
