Thanks for considering contributing! The information below is intended to help you contribute.

## Running tests

```bash
# run all regression tests
make test

# only run regression tests that have $FILTER in regression sql file path
make test FILTER=hnsw
```

## Running benchmarks
This requires Python to be installed. Please check the `Dockerfile.dev` for pip requirements.
```bash
# set up benchmarking, run benchmarks, and print results
make benchmark

# run benchmarks and print results (skip setup)
make benchmark-skip-setup

# print most recent benchmark results (skip setup and running benchmarks)
make benchmark-print-only
```

## VSCode and IntelliSense

`.vscode/c_cpp_properties` is configured to use `./build/compile_commands.json`.
If you build lanterndb in a different directory, make sure to update `.vscode` config appropriately in order to have IntelliSense working.

## Debugging the C codebase

If you make changes to the C codebase, in addition to `make test`, you can also use the `livedebug.py` utility in a `tmux` session to easily attach `gdb` to the psql backend and find out what breaks.
Below is a short recording demonstrating the use of `livedebug.py`:

## Adding/modifying LanternDB's SQL interface

When modifying the SQL interface, you add relevant SQL logic under `sql/`. In addition, you add an update script under `sql/updates`, in a file named `[CURRENT_VERSION]--latest.sql`. You should create this file if it does not exist.

Note that you never modify an already existing update file that does not have `latest` in its name.

The files that do not have `latest` in the name are part of a previous releases and help LanternDB users update to a newer version of the extension via `ALTER EXTENSION lanterndb UPDATE`.

## Browsing the Postgres repository offline

You can download PostgreSQL source code from [their ftp server](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/). Alternatively, can clone their git repository.

```bash
# full repository
git clone https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git
# release head only
git clone --single-branch --branch REL_15_STABLE https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git --depth=1
```
