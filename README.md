Lantern is an open-source PostgreSQL database extension to store vector data, generate embeddings, and handle vector search operations.

It provides a new index type for vector columns called `hnsw` which speeds up `ORDER BY ... LIMIT` queries.

Lantern builds and uses [usearch](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch), a single-header state-of-the-art HNSW implementation.

## üîß Quick Install

If you don‚Äôt have PostgreSQL already, use Lantern with [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/lanterndata/lanterndb
) to get started quickly:
```bash
docker run -it -p 5432:5432 lanterndata/lanterndb
```

To install Lantern on top of PostgreSQL:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lanterndata/lanterndb.git
cd lanterndb
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```
You can also install Lantern on top of PostgreSQL from our [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/lanterndata/lanterndb/releases) via a single make install

## üìñ How to use Lantern 

Lantern retains the standard PostgreSQL interface, so it is compatible with all of your favorite tools in the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

First, enable Lantern in SQL

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION lanterndb;
```

Create a table with a vector column and add your data

```sql
CREATE TABLE small_world (id integer, vector real[3]);
INSERT INTO small_world (id, vector) VALUES (0, '{0,0,0}'), (1, '{0,0,1}');
```

Create an `hnsw` index on the table

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON small_world USING hnsw (vector);
```

Customize `hnsw` index parameters depending on your vector data, such as the distance function (e.g., `dist_l2sq_ops`), index construction parameters, and index search parameters.
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON small_world USING hnsw (vector dist_l2sq_ops)
WITH (M=2, ef_construction=10, ef=4, dims=3);
```

Start querying data
```sql
SELECT id, l2sq_dist(vector, ARRAY[0,0,0]) AS dist
FROM small_world ORDER BY vector <-> ARRAY[0,0,0] LIMIT 1;
```

### A note on operators and operator classes

Lantern supports several distance functions in the index. You only need to specify the distance function used for a column at index creation time. Lantern will automatically infer the distance function to use for search so you always use `<->` operator in search queries.

Note that the operator `<->` is intended exclusively for use with index lookups. If you expect to not use the index in a query, just use the distance function directly (e.g. `l2sq_dist(v1, v2)`)

There are four defined operator classes that can be employed during index creation:

- **`dist_l2sq_ops`**: Default for the type `real[]`
- **`dist_vec_l2sq_ops`**: Default for the type `vector`
- **`dist_cos_ops`**: Applicable to the type `real[]`
- **`dist_hamming_ops`**: Applicable for the type `integer[]`

### Index Construction Parameters

The `M`, `ef`, and `ef_construction` parameters control the performance of the HNSW algorithm for your use case. 
- In general, lower `M` and `ef_construction` speed up index creation at the cost of recall. 
- Lower `M` and `ef` improve search speed and result in fewer shared buffer hits at the cost of recall. Tuning these parameters will require experimentation for your specific use case.

### Miscellaneous
- If you have previously cloned Lantern and would like to update run `git pull && git submodule update`

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features 
- Embedding generation for popular use cases (CLIP model, Hugging Face models, custom model)
- Interoperability with pgvector's data type, so anyone using pgvector can switch to Lantern 
- Parallel index creation capabilities (up to 40x faster than constructors like pgvector + pgembedding)
- Support for creating the index outside of the database and inside another instance allows you to create an index without interrupting database workflows.
- See all of our helper functions to better enable your workflows 

## üèéÔ∏è Performance

Important takeaways: 
- Lantern is already 40x faster than pgvector and Neon‚Äôs pgembedding at creating an index to store data. 
- We match and often outperform pgvector and Neon‚Äôs pgembedding on latency + throughput.
